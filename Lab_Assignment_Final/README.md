### Part I: Theory (40%)
```
1. Explain the difference between interpreters and compilers. Provide examples of
programming languages that use interpreters and compilers. Discuss scenarios
where one is preferred over the other.
2. Differentiate between Just-in-Time (JIT) compilers and traditional compilers.
Provide examples of JIT implementations and their use cases.
3. Define CI/CD and its importance in DevOps. Explain the stages of a CI/CD
pipeline. List tools commonly used in CI/CD and compare their features. Discuss
common bottlenecks in CI/CD pipelines and strategies to resolve them.
4. Define cloud computing and its key characteristics (e.g., scalability, elasticity).
Compare IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS with examples. Discuss the benefits of using cloud
computing in DevOps.
5. Compare Docker containers and virtual machines in terms of architecture,
performance, and use cases. List the advantages of using Docker over virtual
machines in a DevOps workflow.
6. Define IaC and its benefits. Explain the role of Terraform in automating
infrastructure. Provide an example use case of Terraform in a DevOps project.
7. Define observability and its importance in a production environment. Explain the
three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces. List tools commonly used
for observability and discuss how they integrate into the DevOps lifecycle

### Part II: Lab (60%)
```
1. Lab 1 (15%)
Write a Python or Bash script to:
•	Monitor CPU and memory usage of a system.
•	Log the information to a file every minute.
•	Compress the log file daily.
•	Parse and analyze access logs from a web server.
•	Generate insights such as the top 5 IP addresses by request count, most frequently accessed endpoints, and error rates.
•	Automate email notifications if error rates exceed a threshold.
•	Include proper error handling, logging, and parameterization in your script.
```

```
2. Lab 2 (15%)
Create a CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Node.js application using GitHub Actions: https://github.com/arifsetiawan/node-test-sample. The pipeline should include:
•	Code linting and unit tests.
•	Building a Docker image of the application.
•	Deploying the Docker container to a local environment or cloud service.
•	Document the steps to set up and run the pipeline.
```

```
3. Lab 3 (15%)
Deploy an application using Docker and Docker Compose.
Use Docker Compose to set up the application and integrate Grafana for observability (https://github.com/arifsetiawan/node-test-sample):
•	Use Grafana Loki for logging.
•	Use Grafana Mimir for metrics.
•	Create dashboards to monitor logs and metrics.
•	Document how to access and use the Grafana dashboards.
```

4. Lab 4 (15%)
Use Terraform to:
•	Define infrastructure for a Dockerized application.
•	Create at least one container and expose it via a network port.
•	Provide a README.md explaining how to use your Terraform configuration to provision the infrastructure.
```
