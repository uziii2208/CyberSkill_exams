# Hello, I'm a DevOps
**My journey started as a student in Information Security. This is the repository documenting my DevOps internship at CyberSkill.**

## ðŸš€ Why did I choose DevOps...

### Oops... this is a bit hard to explain...
I was initially suggested to follow the DevOps path by a friend of mine, a Fullstack Web Developer at CyberSkill.

And... I happily accepted the suggestion xDDD
